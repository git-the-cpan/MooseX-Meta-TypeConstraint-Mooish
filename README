NAME

    MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish - Translate Moo-style constraints
    to Moose-style

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.001 of
    MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish - released March 12, 2015 as part
    of MooseX-Meta-TypeConstraint-Mooish.

SYNOPSIS

        # easiest is via AttributeShortcuts
        use MooseX::AttributeShortcuts 0.028;
    
        has foo => (
            is  => 'rw',
            isa => sub { die unless $_[0] == 5 },
        );
    
        # or, the hard way
        use MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish;
    
        has foo => (
            is  => 'rw',
            isa => MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish->new(
                constraint => sub { die unless $_[0] == 5 },
            ),
        );

DESCRIPTION

    Moose type constraints are expected to return true if the value passes
    the constraint, and false otherwise; Moo "constraints", on the other
    hand, die if validation fails.

    This metaclass allows for Moo-style constraints; it will wrap them and
    translate their Moo into a dialect Moose understands.

    Note that this is largely to enable functionality in
    MooseX::AttributeShortcuts; the easiest way use this metaclass is by
    using that package. Also, as it's not inconceivable that this
    functionality may be desired in other constraint metaclasses, the bulk
    of this metaclass' functionality is implemented as a trait.
